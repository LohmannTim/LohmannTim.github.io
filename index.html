<h1>About me:</h1>
<p>As a Recruiter and Account Manager in the staffing over the last seven years or so, I've seen a lot of success and a lot of changes in the market.  While I've enjoyed my profession so far, I've decided to take my career in a very new direction and become a Software Engineer.  While I don't have a lot of hands-on experience yet, I have a massive network of IT industry professionals, former clients, and subject matter experts.</p>

<p>As a new father with a six month old son, I'm highly motivated to not only provide for my family but to also build a career that challenges me mentally while also affording me the opportunity to build new and exciting software.  The more I study and learn, the more passionate I become about this career.  I just can't wait to learn more!!!</p>
